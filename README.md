# Gulungus-Bot
Gulungus Bot is a Discord bot written in Python, centering around practicing throw-breaks for _Tekken 8_. Users are incentivized through a server-wide economy system, earning currency for successfully breaking throws.

## Features (Version 0.1)
- **Throw Break Practice** - Users can practice throw breaks against a variety of characters (more to be added)
- **Leaderboard** - Tracks users' scores and displays rankings
- **SQLite integration** - Leverages SQLite to manage leaderboard, allowing for easy backup and restoration

## Installation
Coming soon!

## Usage
**!throwtest** - Starts the _Tekken 8_ throw-break practice session, type in chat "1', "2", or "12" for the corresponding throw shown
**!leaderboard** - Displays the server leaderboard, showcasing the top 10 users with the highest throw-break streaks

## Future Plans
**Detailed Economy System** - Upgrades to the economy where users can use their throw-break currency for games such as BlackJack.
**More Characters** - More characters for users to practice their throw breaks against
**Challenge Others** - Implement the ability for users to challenge each other to see who can get the longest streak
**Multithreaded** -  The bot is designed to support multiple concurrent users; however, it has yet to be tested under simultaneous use.
